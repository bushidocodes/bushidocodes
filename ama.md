## Big Companies vs. Government Agencies vs. Startups

### Question
>"Looking at your LinkedIn you have lots of experience in multiple kinds of organizations. You worked at a big corporation like IBM, a government job at the FAA, and a startup job at Grey Matter. Could you compare the experiences you've had at each of these? Which ones did you enjoy and find fulfilling? Which ones were the most challenging? How did the tech that you used on each job differ?"

### Answer
> Generally, I've had good and bad experiences in all of these settings. I've had engineering wins in each of these setting. At each stage, I've had a "grass is greener" mentality. For example, during my first tech job at IBM. I didn't appreciate the positives, and I focused on the negatives. This is a bad approach to life!
> 
> My answers below aren't all directly informed by specific companies. They're more my general feel of that sort of environment, and I wouldn't say my past employers 100% fit these categories.
> 
> Taking this all together, I think Big Companies are better places to get your initial training as a junior engineer, startups are better places to get breakout opportunities for the few years that you can handle it, and government is mostly either:
> - a tour of service on a government tech team (US Digital Service)
> - an "Iron Rice bowl" where you can earn a solid $140k/yr in the DC area with a union-protected 40 hour work week.

> #### Big Company
> - [👍] A larger company often invests in training. For example, during my first year at IBM, I was part of a specific onboarding program with a cohort of other engineers. We were assigned to our teams, but spent about half of our time doing dedicated training and education. Several of these folks are close friends nearly a decade later. If I were to estimate the cost of the instructors and travel, IBM probably spent over $100k on my training during my first year. I also had dedicated mentors (graduate from the previous cohort), coaching, etc.
> - [👍] Personnel at larger companies can be much more senior. This means that you work with folks that potentially have 10+ years of experience. The managers thus tend to actually know what they're doing. The engineers really know their stuff and have a lot of knowledge that you can pick up by cross-training alongside them.
> - [👍] Potential for a culture that actually values good software engineering and encourages proper uses of data structures and algorithms
> - [👎] Sometimes the crusty old timers can be super bitter 
> - [👎] Advancement can feel slow. A few years in after you've hit your groove, it can feel like you plateau. In fact, you really do, as evidenced by the engineers and managers that settle out in their roles. Promotions settle out to 2-3% annual increase 
> - [👎] Because advancement gets slow, differentiating yourself can get political. Things that feel out of your control like getting good or bad assignments can really make or break your ability to advance. To some degree, you need to know how to "play the game" to get the good assignments.
> - [👎] Larger companies are more likely to have large offshore teams. The relationship of US engineers and offshore engineers can be toxic because executives seek to move work to places where developers are cheap. US engineers thus can be shuttled between "high priority" products as "low value" products shift overseas. When this transition happens, it's always quite possible to be laid off via a resource action. 
> 
> Tech: More "Enterprise." Java, Linux, Shell/Python Scripts. Substantial integration with "legacy systems," so think COBOL apps on mainframes. This complex heterogeneity led to some pretty meaty system problems. Many systems now have been "lifted and shifted" to the cloud, meaning virtual machines have migrated, but the systems were not built to leverage the flexiblity of cloud services.
> 
> #### Government
> - [👍] Strong work/life balance culture. You literally are represented by a union, with all the pros/cons of that
> - [👍] Public service is inherently rewarding, and the missions are much more meaningful and impactful. See https://www.usds.gov/projects for an idea.
> - [👍] The baseline of expected performance is so low that good engineering can make you standout.
> - [👎] Very very few actual opportunities to be an engineer. Most engineering work is outsourced to federal contractors. Most engineers are predominantly responsible with monitoring and overseeing contractors to ensure that they're doing solid work and not cutting corners excessively.
> - [👎] Government doesn't like to hire junior engineers or provide much training
> - [👎] Pay is low relative to private industry. Junior = $50-70k. Mid = $70-100k. Senior = $100-150k.
> - [👎] Process can be incredibly slow, which is deeply burnout inducing.
> 
> Tech: Similar to Big Company, but generally worse maintained. Typically government systems are not properly maintained because of the weird dynamics of the contractor / outsourcing agreements. Lots of scripting together of managed cloud services these days.
> 
> #### Startup
> - [👍] Huge potential for promotion. The startup is probably growing quickly and it is very easy to promote purely by virtue of having a few more months of experience
> - [👍] Opportunity to build something from scratch.
> - [👍] Opportunity to be a "jack of all trades." Unlike big companies, engineers are not very specialized in this setting.
> - [👍/👎] Everyone has way more responsibility than they are qualified for. That means tremendous pressure. This can help you learn, but it can also break your soul.
> - [👍/👎] Compensation is often a low salary with some sort of stock options ("sweat equity"). This is thus like a risky investment. Many engineers have been burned and not recouped the foregone wages, but some reap huge windfalls.
> - [👎] Because of above, processes are not solid. Hiring, onboarding, etc. is "fly by the seat of your pants." Candidates will show up for interviews, and everyone forgot, so you'll end up interviewing a candidate cold and read their resume for the first time in front of them.
> - [👎] Strategy can shift wildly. Your product and team might be dissolved in three months.
> - [👎] Poor work/life balance. Depending on what is happening in the company, unpaid overtime for working over nights and weekends happens a lot. You can say no to this, but there can be a strong dynamic between unpaid overtime and advancement. For junior engineers, all the self-education that you need to do to be successful in your career generally 
>
> Tech: Usually the new shiny. Projects are new and "greenfield," so you get to use Rust, Golang, React, etc. Probably all of these shiny things are used poorly.
