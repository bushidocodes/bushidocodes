### Bio

_tldr: I'm a military veteran turned software engineer with a bit of a nerdy pedigree_

I grew up in [Fairfield, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_California), the exurb half way between San Francisco and Sacramento. I was a free lunch public school kid, but didn't know what that meant, as I thought it was normal and middle class to [buy McD burgers on the 29Â¢ day and then freeze them to last through the week](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/3lgnvt/who_else_remembers_when_mcdonalds_ran_the_029/).

My first serious exposure to computers occurred when my childless great-aunt that worked for [Amdahl, a defunct Silicon Valley tech company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl_Corporation), took me to the '93 "Bring your Son/Daughter to work day." I was dropped in front of a terminal running [UTS, a proprietary Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl_UTS), and later that day, I heard a talk on the World Wide Web, which sounded like something to do with big spiders.

This event ignited my interest in computers, but since I didn't have one at home, I had to get by checking out books about them from the library and occasionally get "lab time" at school or the library on dumb terminals or primitive Apple IIs. Over time, I did odd jobs for friends and family to save up money, and eventually I was able to buy all the parts I needed from the [Computer Show and Sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFf-mMxo8JI). My first home computer was fully assembled and booted up Windows 95 in '96 or so, when I was 10-11. By 7th grade, I was bullied pretty severely, failed out of my class, and then had to remediate courses over the summer. The next year, I switched schools three times in a year.

When things stabilized, I began to do paid IT work, starting in 8th grade with [Mac LCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC) and continuing through high school with Windows systems. I earned something like \$10/hr doing this sort of work from 2000-2003. I used some of that money to get my [CompTIA A+ Certification](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/8b1f7007-cc58-41cd-935d-d32e9f4b1c17/linked_in_profile).

During high school, I matured and got interested in the military through [high school JROTC](https://www.instagram.com/vandenafjrotc/). I really began to thrive by having structure and discipline, and I grew out of being an awkward little nerdy kid. After 9/11, I decided that I would join the military. I applied to West Point, Annapolis, VMI, and the Citadel, and if I didn't get into any of those with scholarships, I planned to enlist in the infantry. For reasons that are beyond my comprehension, I got into West Point, changing the trajectory of my life. US taxpayers gave me a tremendous education. As much as possible, I tried to travel and get enrichment activities, since I didn't really have that stuff as much as a kid. I participated in the [Sandhurst Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandhurst_Competition) and did a semester abroad at the [German Military Academy in Hamburg](https://www.hsu-hh.de/en/). Later, I graduated and commissioned as an Army officer.

In the 10+ years since leaving the Army, I've reentered the tech industry. I worked at IBM, focused on mainframes and Linux, which was eerily reminiscent of the sorts of systems I encountered in the Amdahl '93 "Bring your Son/Daughter to Work Day." I've worked at the FAA on the rollout of the FAA Cloud Services project. More recently, I worked at Decipher Tech Studios, doing startup-y fullstack development on their [Grey Matter product](https://greymatter.io/grey-matter).

For the past two years, I've been using my GI Bill to earn my MS in CS from George Washington University. My research interests are mostly in the area of systems programming, but I also have a passing interest in the technologies and standards underpinning the open web.

Thought research does not currently afford me much free time, I'm also a member of [Operation Code](https://operationcode.org/), and as much as possible, I try to advice and mentor transitioning service members about how to learn to code and break into tech. In the past when I've had more free time, I've served as the DC Chapter Lead and organized area meetups.
