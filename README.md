## Hi, I'm Sean

### I write Low-level Systems Software and Kernel-safe Bytecode Interpreters in C and C++ 

Currently, I work on proprietary bytescodes used in the CrowdStrike Falcon sensor. In the recent history, I applied my skills as a [GWSystems](https://github.com/gwsystems) researcher focused on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) outside of the browser.

I'm also a US Army veteran turned software engineer with a bit of a nerdy pedigree. Read more [on my bio page](https://github.com/bushidocodes/bushidocodes/blob/master/bio.md)

### I'm currently working on...:
- CrowdStrike Falcon Sensor

### Recent Projects of Note:
